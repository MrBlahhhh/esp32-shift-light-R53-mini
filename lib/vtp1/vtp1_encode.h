/* VTP/1 reference encoder — C99, no dependencies.
 *
 * The device-side half. Firmware needs this and an app does not, so it is a
 * separate translation unit: a decoder-only client links vtp1.c alone, and a
 * device links this alone if it never parses.
 *
 * Every function returns the number of bytes written, or -1 when the output
 * buffer is too small. Nothing is written on -1.
 *
 * The encoder ENFORCES the specification rather than trusting its caller:
 * a field whose validity bit is clear is written as zero regardless of what
 * the struct holds (SPEC.md §5.1). Firmware that computes a stale altitude
 * and then clears the bit therefore cannot leak the stale value onto the wire.
